## Profile

I am a pro-active person with an attitude to face new challenges or solve problems, used to teamwork and under pressure. I have experience in the web environment, both in development with an emphasis on back-end and cloud deployment, with development tools such as Laravel, Flask, .NET, and in the AWS and GCP cloud environment. I attach great importance to compliance with the previously established dates of deliveries but with flexibility to changes if necessary, in turn good programming practices. In addition, I like the continuous learning of new technologies, adapting to change easily. I consider the responsible use of technologies and data processing as a responsibility of the engineer.
